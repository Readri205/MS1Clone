<h2>MTB & GRAVEL BIKE TOURS</h2>

<h3>CATALONIA & PYRENEES</h3>

The site is advertising MTB & Gravel bike tours in the Catalonia and Pyrenees region. It also advertises attractive reasons for the tourist visitor in terms of the geography, history, culture and culinary delights. As it is primarily a ‘tourist’ website attracting B2C, the websites main aim is to appeal emotionally to people who would wish to experience the region by bike.

The organisation is new and not yet in operation. More details in terms of tour content, social link and pricing will be developed in the near future. The site currently is structured as an initial draft that will be developed further as the business is developed.

The site went through the high level structure and design process per the Code Institute UXD structure [here](https://github.com/Readri205/my-first-milestone-project/blob/master/assets/documents/CI%20-%20Milestone%20Project%201%20(Richard%20Read).pdf).

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. Easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation in terms of their culture and style.
        2. Easily navigate throughout the site to find content about tours and how they are offered.
        3. Look for details on how the user can get in contact either immediately or passively though a form.
        4. See what more information of write ups, images and videos on social media.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. Find information about tours on offer.
        2. Find alternative ways to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
        3. Download any further information via the download link.
        4. Submit contact details via the form submission.
        5. Find social links to view specific activity like write ups, images or videos..

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. Check to see if there are any newly added tours, destinations or pricing amendments.
        2. Check to see if there are any new social activity write ups, images or videos.
        3. Submit contact details if not already done so.

-   ### Design

    -   #### Imagery
        -   As it is an ‘emotionally’ driven marketing tool, the website makes extreme use of graphic imagery, over laid with text content to add further appeal.

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colour used is grey in order to provide a neutral contrast to the colour images and to highlight different sections of the website.

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Exo font is the main font used throughout the whole website. Exo is used in the main sections, as whilst it is clean and crisp, its curved edges make it less formal and more engaging to the user. The Roboto font is used in the footer section. Roboto is used as it is a clean and crisp font, but with a more direct and business-like style as a user is searching for specific information in this section. If the Exo and Roboto fonts do not feed through, the fall back option is sans-serif.
    
-   ### Wireframes
    
    -   The site consists of three pages;

        -   Home page: draws potential customer through the core activity and the regional attractions.
        -   Tours page: draws potential customer through high level description of the types of tours available.
        -   Contact page: summarises the tours, indicates price of tours and allows for contact and enquiry to be made, through form submission, phone call or both.

    -   The links below show each of the respective wireframe page design for desktop and mobile;

            -   The Navbar will sit on top of the header image but will be fixed on scroll down. The Navbar text will be white on an opaque grey background.

            -   Middle section of each page will contain three image boxes with relevant text contained and entered within.

            -   The footer will also be three sections with traditional ‘About’, ‘Download’ and ‘Social’ sections.

            -   All three pages will have same image and text look and feel.

    -   Responsive design for screen size less than 992px:
            
        -   At screen sizes 992px or less: the central image boxes will move from horizontal and stack vertically.  It will be required to scroll down the page to view the next image boxes and the footer section. The footer section will remain horizontal.

        -   Mobile: the three central images will move to vertical to occupy the full width of the screen. To see the below sections it will be required to scroll down the page.

        -   Mobile: the footer thee sections will each occupy the full width of the screen but each section will position vertically. To see the below sections it will be required to scroll down the page.

    -   The images used in this wireframe may not be the final images used in the website.

## Features

-   The website is designed to be responsive on all device sizes.

-   The web pages do not yet show an organisation logo. The logo can be added once designed by the organisation.

-   Business features will be developed as the new business is developed, to provide more content on tour details, a more extensive list of tours and tour types and a more extensive pricing structure.

-   The website is designed to be expanded with the current structure by providing more pages on tours and tour details.

-   Extensive social media will also be developed in conjunction with the website and the website will include direct social media interaction (write-ups, images, videos).

-   It is expected that the site ccan be used to create an extensive customer database with full communication interactivity with the customer base.

-   The communication icons, whilst hover effects are active, the links do not yet create actual communication links and will be added at a later date when the comunications are live.

-   The Download itinery PDF document is an example only and is not intended to be a complete document at this stage. This document will be developed by the orgnaisation in the near future.

-   The website form is an example only as does not submit entered data. The form will be developed at a later stage by the organisation.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps;

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template);
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Use this template" Button on the menu;
3. Fill in the box next to you user ID to create the repository name for you project;
4. Click "Create repository from template";
5. The page will return to the main page for the repository;
6. Click on the "Gitpod" on the menu to create the Gitpod workspace;
7. Development is accesed directly via Gitpod in the Gitpod Workspace;
8. The project is then regulary deployed back to Github from Gitpod using the Git Push process;
9. All Gitpod push actions are listed in the Version Control section below.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

(These steps are assumed 'correct' and not tested as it appears its not yet possile to "Fork" the project as the option is greyed out)

By forking the GitHub Repository a copy can be made of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps;

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Readri205/my-first-milestone-project);
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button;
3. A copy of the repository will appear in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

(These steps are assumed 'correct' and not tested as it appears its not yet possile to clone into an 'organisation' account, however it is possible to clone into GitHub Desktop and/or Download the 'zip' file)

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Readri205/my-first-milestone-project);
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download";
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link;
4. Open Git Bash;
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made;
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
